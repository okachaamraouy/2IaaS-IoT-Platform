Meteorological stations are extensively used for gathering accurate Real-Time (RT) data, which plays a vital role in smart and precision agriculture. The aim of this work is to make Davis Vantage Pro2 (VP2) weather station data accessible in RT by creating a
simple library for Single-Board Computers (SBCs) with operating systems based on Linux, regarding minimization of resources such as RAM, CPU, and power computing. This project aims to surpass the capabilities of the WeeWX weather system, which is infeasible to implement on various types of SBCs with minimal resources. Moreover, WeeWX does not provide developers with the freedom to manually configure it as needed.
This solution renders the VP2 weather station a flexible end-device in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The library was developed as a novel weather station RT data acquisition, to facilitate communication with the VP2 console. In this work, we will get into steps to implement the solution, including development modeling of the library to visualize and design our system, the practical realization of the proposed system, and
a remote web application example to visualize VP2 weather station RT data.
